### A little more about me…

Hey there! I’m Khuzayma, a Computer Science major with a strong foundation in mathematics at UMass Amherst, focused on building practical systems in AI, data science, and software engineering.

I’ve worked as a Game Developer Intern at Game Storm Studios, where I built gameplay systems and processed large volumes of telemetry data to improve player experience. On campus, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for Calculus I, helping students master core mathematical concepts and problem-solving strategies.

Right now, I’m sharpening my skills through hands-on projects in machine learning, full-stack development, and data-driven applications, while preparing for roles in AI and quantitative tech.

When I’m not coding or studying, I’m usually watching Formula 1, cricket, or exploring my passion for fragnances.
